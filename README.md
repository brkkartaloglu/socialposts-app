It is a simple social posts app that allows users to post/participate events within their peer groups/teams.

## Setup and Run:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Important

- To start app locally, you don't have to deploy your backend side to Heroku etc. but you need to determine your MongoDB connection url in CONNECTION_URL variable (server/index.js)
- Be aware also you need to enter your backend url into API variable (client/api/index.js). If you dont have any backend deployment use http://localhost:5000
- Add your google client id to use OAuth in clientId variable (client/Auth/Auth.js)
